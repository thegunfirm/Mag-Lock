# Filter Preservation Test

## Test Steps:

1. **Go to Handguns category**
   - Click "Handguns" in the ribbon
   - Apply a filter (e.g., select "Glock" as manufacturer)
   - Apply another filter (e.g., select "9mm" as caliber)
   - Note: These should be tracked as user-applied filters

2. **Navigate to Rifles category**
   - Click "Rifles" in the ribbon
   - The filters should remain applied
   - Console should show: "User applied filters: ['manufacturer', 'caliber']"

3. **Navigate back to Handguns**
   - Click "Handguns" in the ribbon
   - The Glock and 9mm filters should still be active
   - Results should show filtered handguns

## Expected Behavior:
- User-applied filters (manufacturer, caliber) should persist across category changes
- System filters (productType) should update automatically
- Non-user-applied filters should reset to defaults

## Current Implementation:
- `userAppliedFilters` Set tracks which filters the user has actively set
- `handleFilterChange` adds/removes filters from tracking based on value presence
- `useEffect` for category changes preserves user-applied filters
- `clearFilters` resets both filter values and tracking

## Debug Console Output:
- "User applied filters: [array]" shows tracked filters
- "Setting productType to: [type]" shows system updates
