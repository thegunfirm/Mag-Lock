This is for the Order Status Drop Down:
Status definitions (who sets it / trigger)

Submitted — App sets
You POST the order to Engine (for DS) or mark an SO ready for IH. Store PONum, set Ordering Account.

Hold - App sets - FFL or Gun Count Hold otherwise blank

Confirmed — “Shipper” accepts the order

DS: RSR confirms → Engine response StatusCode=="00" (and usually an RSR order #).

IH: TGF confirms → payment captured, compliance/FFL ok, stock allocated or PO raised.

Rule of thumb: “Confirmed” = accepted by whoever will ship (RSR for DS, TGF for IH).

Processing — System sets automatically
After Confirmed and before first tracking.

DS: we’ve got an accepted order at RSR; awaiting pick/pack/backorder decisions.

IH: pick ticket created / label pending / waiting on inbound from distributor for IH fulfillment.
No manual input needed—flip to Processing right after Confirmed until a shipment exists.

Partially Shipped — System sets automatically
When at least one line/child-shipment has tracking, but not all committed qty are shipped.
Works fine even if you split by consignee (Customer vs FFL vs TGF):

Create child Shipments (receiver = Customer/FFL/TGF).

Order-level status = Partially Shipped while 0 < shippedQty < committedQty across all shipments.

Shipped — System sets automatically
All committed quantities have tracking numbers across all child shipments (no lines left open/backordered).

Delivered — System sets automatically
All child shipments show delivered (carrier event for IH; RSR feed/carrier event for DS).
Your Display Summary then shows “Delivered to Customer/FFL/TGF”.

Rejected — Engine/RSR or App sets

DS: Engine response not "00" or later EERR file = rejected.

IH: payment fail/compliance fail/stock unable → rejected.

Cancelled — Manual or system
Cancelled before shipment (or residual lines cancelled). If some lines shipped, keep order Partially Shipped and mark the cancelled lines individually.
