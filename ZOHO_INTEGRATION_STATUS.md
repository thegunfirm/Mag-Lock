# üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: Zoho Integration Authentication Failure

## Current Status: ‚ùå PRODUCTS NOT BEING CREATED

### The Problem:
While the checkout process itself is working (routing, compliance, payment), the **critical Zoho integration is failing** due to authentication issues.

### Evidence:
1. **‚úÖ Orders Created**: Database shows orders with status "Manual Processing Required"
2. **‚ùå Zoho Deal IDs**: Orders have Zoho Deal IDs, but these are stale from previous tests
3. **‚ùå Token Rejection**: Current Zoho API calls return "invalid oauth token" error
4. **‚ùå Product Creation**: No products being created in Zoho Products module
5. **‚ùå Subform Assignment**: No products being assigned to Deal subforms

### Authentication Error:
```
‚ùå Fresh token is being rejected by Zoho API
This usually means:
1. Token format is incorrect
2. Token permissions are insufficient  
3. Token is for wrong environment (sandbox vs production)
```

### Impact:
- **Checkout Process**: ‚úÖ Working (endpoint, compliance, payment)
- **Order Creation**: ‚úÖ Working (database orders created)
- **Zoho Contact Creation**: ‚ùå Failing (authentication)
- **Zoho Product Creation**: ‚ùå Failing (authentication)
- **Deal Subform Population**: ‚ùå Failing (authentication)

### Root Cause:
The system is using webservices credentials from environment secrets, but the token is being rejected by Zoho's API. This suggests:

1. **Token Expiration**: The stored token may have expired
2. **Scope Issues**: Token may lack required permissions for Products module
3. **Environment Mismatch**: Token may be for wrong Zoho environment
4. **API Changes**: Zoho may have changed authentication requirements

### Required Action:
**IMMEDIATE**: Fix Zoho authentication to enable:
- ‚úÖ Product creation by SKU in Zoho Products module
- ‚úÖ Deal subform population with product line items  
- ‚úÖ Complete order-to-CRM synchronization

Without working Zoho authentication, the critical requirement of "Product Code (SKU) must use Manufacturer Part Number for Product Module creation" **cannot be fulfilled**.
