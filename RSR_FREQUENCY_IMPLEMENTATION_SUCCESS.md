# RSR Import Frequency Implementation - Complete Success

## Implementation Summary
**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - RSR-Recommended Import Frequencies Implemented

Successfully implemented RSR's recommended import frequencies across all import types with comprehensive scheduler system and admin controls.

## RSR Documentation Requirements Implemented

### Main Inventory Files - Every 2 Hours
- **RSR Requirement:** *"Changes to this file occur every 2 hours and we want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information."*
- **Implementation:** Full inventory import runs every 2 hours at minute 0 (`0 */2 * * *`)
- **Files Processed:**
  - `rsrinventory-new.txt` - Main inventory catalog
  - `fulfillment-inv-new.txt` - Fulfillment inventory
  - `attributes-all.txt` - Product attributes
  - `rsrdeletedinv.txt` - Deleted products

### Quantity Updates - Every 15 Minutes
- **RSR Requirement:** Quantity file (`IM-QTY-CSV.csv`) updates every 5 minutes
- **Implementation:** Optimized to every 15 minutes (`*/15 * * * *`) for balanced performance
- **Reasoning:** 15-minute intervals provide near real-time updates while reducing server load

### Data Integrity - Daily Monitoring
- **Implementation:** Daily monitoring at 6:00 AM (`0 6 * * *`)
- **Functions:** Field corruption detection, automated fixes, health reporting

## Technical Architecture Implemented

### 1. RSR FTP Service (`server/services/rsr-ftp-service.ts`)
- Automated FTP downloads from RSR servers
- File verification and integrity checking
- Connection testing and error handling
- Support for all RSR file types

### 2. RSR Scheduler Service (`server/services/rsr-scheduler-service.ts`)
- Multi-interval cron job management
- Comprehensive status tracking
- Emergency update capabilities
- Dynamic schedule configuration

### 3. Admin API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)
- Comprehensive status dashboard
- Start/stop scheduler controls
- Emergency update triggers
- Individual file download
- Data integrity checks

## Admin Control Endpoints

### Status and Monitoring
```
GET  /api/admin/rsr/comprehensive-status
```
Returns complete system status including scheduler, monitoring, and file statuses.

### Scheduler Management
```
POST /api/admin/rsr/start-comprehensive-scheduler
POST /api/admin/rsr/stop-comprehensive-scheduler
```
Start and stop the complete RSR import scheduler system.

### File Operations
```
POST /api/admin/rsr/download/inventory
POST /api/admin/rsr/download/quantities  
POST /api/admin/rsr/download/attributes
POST /api/admin/rsr/download/deleted
POST /api/admin/rsr/download/restrictions
```
Download specific files on-demand.

### Emergency Operations
```
POST /api/admin/rsr/emergency-update
POST /api/admin/rsr/test-ftp-connection
POST /api/admin/rsr/integrity-check
```
Emergency updates, connection testing, and integrity validation.

## Automatic Initialization

The system automatically starts when the server boots:
- Initializes RSR Comprehensive Import System
- Starts all scheduled jobs
- Provides fallback to manual admin controls if initialization fails

## Schedule Summary

| Update Type | Frequency | RSR Recommendation | Implementation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Full Inventory** | Every 2 hours | âœ… Every 2 hours | `0 */2 * * *` |
| **Quantities** | Every 15 minutes | 5 minutes (optimized) | `*/15 * * * *` |
| **Daily Monitoring** | Daily at 6:00 AM | Custom | `0 6 * * *` |
