## Technical Implementation Confirmed

### Code Implementation
- **server/services/zoho-order-fields-service.ts**: Product creation with proper field mapping
- **server/order-zoho-integration.ts**: Deal subform creation using correct Product_Code values
- **Field Mapping Logic**: Product_Code = manufacturerPartNumber, Distributor_Part_Number = sku

### Verification Method
- Created complete test order with three real accessories
- Used sandbox payment processing (no RSR order submission)
- Verified field population in Zoho CRM deal subforms
- Confirmed proper Product ID references in subform lookups

## Issue Resolution Timeline
1. **Initial Issue**: Product_Code field was empty in both Products module and subforms
2. **Root Cause**: Missing manufacturerPartNumber mapping in product creation logic
3. **Fix Applied**: Added proper field mapping in zoho-order-fields-service.ts
4. **Verification**: Created test order TGF-TEST-ACCESSORIES-001 with three products
5. **Result**: All Product_Code fields correctly populated with manufacturer part numbers
