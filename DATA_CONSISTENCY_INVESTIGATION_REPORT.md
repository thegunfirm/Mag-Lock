# Data Consistency Investigation Report
**Database vs Algolia Search Index Analysis**

## Investigation Summary

I investigated the item count differences between the PostgreSQL database and Algolia search index to assess data consistency across the system.

## Key Findings

### Item Count Discrepancy
- **Database Total**: 29,822 products
- **Algolia Total**: 32,835 products (from search API)
- **Algolia Facets**: 30,716 products (from filter options)
- **Difference**: ~3,013 more items in Algolia than database

### Stock Status Comparison
**Database:**
- In stock: 29,796 products
- Out of stock: 26 products

**Algolia (from facets):**
- In stock: 28,987 products  
- Out of stock: 1,729 products

### Data Quality Assessment
✅ **Database Quality**:
- No duplicate SKUs found
- No NULL or empty SKU values
- Clean product structure

✅ **Manufacturer Consistency**:
Database and Algolia show similar top manufacturers with slight count variations:
- RUGER: 782 (DB) vs 783 (Algolia)
- MAGPUL: 756 (DB) vs 777 (Algolia)
- SIG: 641 (DB) vs 642 (Algolia)

## Possible Causes of Discrepancy

### 1. **Synchronization Lag**
- Algolia may contain historical data that was later removed from database
- Incomplete sync processes leaving orphaned records in search index

### 2. **Index Management Issues**
- Multiple indexing operations without proper cleanup
- Test data or duplicate entries in Algolia index

### 3. **Different Data Sources**
- Algolia might be receiving data from multiple sources
- Historical imports that weren't properly reconciled

### 4. **Indexing Logic Differences**
- Database shows 26 out-of-stock items vs Algolia's 1,729
- This suggests different stock status update mechanisms

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Reindex Algolia** - Perform complete reindex from current database
2. **Audit Sync Process** - Review RSR synchronization scripts
3. **Clean Stale Records** - Remove orphaned entries from Algolia

### Monitoring Setup
1. **Daily Count Comparison** - Automated checks between DB and Algolia
2. **Sync Health Dashboard** - Track indexing success rates
3. **Data Quality Alerts** - Flag significant count discrepancies

### Investigation Priority
**HIGH** - The 3,000+ item difference indicates a significant data consistency issue that could affect:
- Search accuracy
- Inventory management
- Customer experience
- Business reporting

## Next Steps Required

1. **Identify Source** - Determine which system has authoritative data
2. **Data Reconciliation** - Map discrepancies to specific product records
3. **Sync Process Review** - Audit current indexing workflows
4. **Cleanup Strategy** - Plan for resolving inconsistencies
