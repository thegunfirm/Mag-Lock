## üéØ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - ZOHO DATETIME FIELD RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Issue Resolution Summary:
- **Root Cause**: The `Email_Verification_Time_Stamp` custom field in Zoho CRM was causing "INVALID_DATA" errors despite correct YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
- **Solution Applied**: Temporarily exclude the problematic timestamp field while keeping the critical `Email_Verified` checkbox field operational
- **Result**: Zoho Contact creation now works successfully with email verification status tracking

### Final Successful Test:
