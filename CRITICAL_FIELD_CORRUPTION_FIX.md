# CRITICAL FIELD CORRUPTION FIX - Complete Resolution

## Issue Summary
**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical Business Data Corruption  
**Scope:** 99.96% of inventory (29,810 of 29,822 products)

### Root Cause
The RSR import logic was incorrectly using RSR distributor codes as product SKUs instead of manufacturer part numbers. This created a fundamental business logic error where customers saw internal distributor codes instead of actual manufacturer part numbers.

### Business Impact
- Customers could not search by actual manufacturer part numbers
- Product identification was completely corrupted across the platform
- Order processing would fail when trying to map customer searches to actual products
- SEO and product discovery severely impacted

## Technical Solution

### Field Mapping Correction
**Before (Corrupted):**
- Product SKU = RSR Stock Number (Field 1) - WRONG
- RSR Stock Number = Not stored - MISSING

**After (Fixed):**
- Product SKU = Manufacturer Part Number (Field 12) - CORRECT
- RSR Stock Number = RSR Stock Number (Field 1) - CORRECT

### Implementation

#### 1. Updated RSR File Processor
**File:** `server/services/distributors/rsr/rsr-file-processor.ts`
- Fixed to use Field 12 (manufacturerPartNumber) as product SKU
- Added proper storage of Field 1 (stockNumber) as rsrStockNumber for ordering
- Added logging to track corrections

#### 2. Created Correction Script
**File:** `scripts/fix-field-corruption-and-enable-monitoring.ts`
- Comprehensive script to fix existing corrupted data
- Maps RSR records to products using current RSR stock numbers
- Updates products to use proper manufacturer part numbers as SKUs
- Preserves RSR stock numbers for ordering functionality

#### 3. Established Monitoring System
**File:** `server/services/rsr-monitoring-service.ts`
- Daily monitoring at 6 AM to detect future corruption
- Automatic fixing of any detected issues
- Comprehensive reporting and alerts

## Results (Live Status)

### Current Progress
- **Total Products:** 29,822
- **Fixed Products:** 2,011 (6.74%)
- **Still Corrupted:** 27,811 (93.26%)
- **Status:** Active correction in progress

### Examples of Successful Fixes
```
RSR Code      â†’ Product SKU     Product
ALGACT        â†’ 05-199         ALG Combat Trigger
B5SOP-1097    â†’ SOP-1097       B5 SOPMOD Stock MIL-SPEC ODG
AMA2VFGBLK    â†’ A2VFGBLK       Amend2 M-LOK Vertical Foregrip BLK
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Corruption Status
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sku = rsr_stock_number THEN 1 END) as still_corrupted,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN sku != rsr_stock_number THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_fixed
FROM products;
```

### View Fixed Examples
```sql
SELECT name, sku, rsr_stock_number, manufacturer 
FROM products 
WHERE rsr_stock_number != sku 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Monitoring System
- Daily automated checks at 6 AM
- Automatic fixing of detected corruption
- Alert system for any anomalies

### 2. Import Logic Hardening
- Removed all fallback logic that could cause corruption
- Strict field mapping enforcement
- Comprehensive logging of all import operations

### 3. Documentation
- Complete RSR field mapping documented
- Clear separation of business logic responsibilities
- Monitoring procedures established

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Progress** - The correction script is running continuously
2. **Verify Completion** - Once corruption drops to 0%, verify with test orders
3. **Production Validation** - Ensure customer search and ordering works correctly
4. **Documentation Update** - Update all related documentation

## Critical Success Factors

âœ… **Field Separation Fixed** - RSR codes and manufacturer part numbers properly separated  
âœ… **Monitoring Enabled** - Daily automated monitoring prevents future corruption  
âœ… **Import Logic Corrected** - Root cause eliminated from import process  
ðŸ”„ **Data Correction Active** - 93.26% of corruption still being fixed
