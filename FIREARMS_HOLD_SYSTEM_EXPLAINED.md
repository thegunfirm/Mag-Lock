# How the Firearms Hold System Works

## Overview
The firearms compliance system creates **holds** on orders containing firearms to ensure proper FFL verification and compliance with federal regulations. Here's exactly how it operates:

---

## üîí How Holds Work

### 1. **Order Detection**
When a customer places an order containing firearms:
- System scans cart items for `isFirearm: true` or `requiresFFL: true`
- Identifies products that need Federal Firearms License verification
- Triggers compliance check process automatically

### 2. **Hold Placement**
The system places **two types of holds**:

**FFL Hold** (Most Common):
- **Reason**: "Firearm requires FFL verification"
- **Status**: Order set to "Pending FFL"
- **Payment**: Authorization only (money reserved, not charged)
- **Action Required**: Customer must provide valid FFL dealer information

**Multi-Firearm Hold** (Policy Enforcement):
- **Reason**: "Customer has purchased multiple firearms within policy window"
- **Trigger**: More than 5 firearms in 30 days
- **Status**: Order set to "Compliance Hold"
- **Action Required**: Admin review and possible override

### 3. **Payment Processing** - UPDATED POLICY
```
PREVIOUS: Hold Order:  Authorize ‚Üí HOLD ‚Üí Capture (after FFL verification)
NEW:      Hold Order:  Authorize + Capture ‚Üí HOLD RSR PROCESSING
```

**NEW BILLING POLICY (UPDATED)**:
- ‚úÖ Payment is **CHARGED IMMEDIATELY** for all firearms
- ‚úÖ Customer's card is billed right away (no auth-only)
- ‚úÖ RSR processing is **HELD** until human approval
- ‚úÖ No payment authorization expiration concerns
- ‚úÖ Customer gets immediate confirmation that payment went through

## üîÑ Hold Resolution Process

### Step 1: Customer Provides FFL
```
Customer ‚Üí Selects FFL Dealer ‚Üí System validates license
```

### Step 2: FFL Verification
```
POST /api/firearms-compliance/orders/12345/ffl/attach
{
  "fflDealerId": "FFL123",
  "verifyFFL": true
}
```

### Step 3: Hold Release
```
Order Status: "Pending FFL" ‚Üí "Processing"
Payment: Authorize.Net capture transaction
Zoho: Deal stage updated to "Closed Won"
Fulfillment: Order released to warehouse
```
