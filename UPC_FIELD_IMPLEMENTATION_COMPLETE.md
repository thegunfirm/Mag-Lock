# UPC Field Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented UPC field support throughout the Zoho CRM integration system for TheGunFirm.com.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Product Creation Service (zoho-product-lookup-service.ts)
- **Added UPC field to ProductData interface**: `upcCode?: string`
- **Updated product creation payload**: Added conditional UPC field mapping
- **Enhanced findOrCreateProductBySKU method**: Now accepts and processes UPC codes

### 2. Zoho Service (zoho-service.ts)
- **Updated findOrCreateProductBySKU interface**: Added `upcCode?: string` parameter
- **Enhanced product lookup parameters**: Passes UPC code to product lookup service
- **Improved subform creation**: Added UPC field to deal subform records

### 3. Deal Subform Integration
- **Added UPC field to subform records**: `UPC: item.upcCode || ''`
- **Enhanced order item mapping**: Subforms now include UPC codes from order items
- **Maintained data consistency**: UPC flows from order items → subform records

### 4. Order Processing Integration
- **Product module integration**: UPC codes are stored when products are created
- **Subform population**: UPC codes appear in deal line items
- **End-to-end data flow**: UPC preserved throughout order processing pipeline

## Field Mapping Confirmed

### Products Module
- **UPC Field**: Maps `upcCode` → `UPC` in Zoho Products module
- **Mfg_Part_Number**: Manufacturer part number (Product_Code field)
- **RSR_Stock_Number**: Distributor part number

### Deal Subforms (Subform_1)
- **UPC Field**: Maps `item.upcCode` → `UPC` in subform records
- **Product_Code**: Manufacturer part number from SKU
- **Distributor_Part_Number**: RSR stock number
