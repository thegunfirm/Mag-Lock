## Key Achievements

### ðŸŽ¯ Email Verification â†’ Zoho Sync Flow
1. **User Registration**: User registers with email/password
2. **Email Verification**: User clicks verification link in email
3. **Local Account Creation**: Account created in PostgreSQL database
4. **Zoho Contact Creation**: Contact automatically created in Zoho CRM with:
   - `Email_Verified: true`
   - `Tier: Bronze` (or selected tier)
   - `Lead_Source: Website Registration`
   - All user profile information
5. **Login Ready**: User can immediately login with verified account

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Background refresh every 50 minutes prevents API failures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if Zoho operations fail (local verification still works)
- **Field Mapping**: Correct API field names using underscores (`Email_Verified` not `Email Verified`)
- **Contact Creation**: Creates new contacts with verification status during email verification
- **Contact Updates**: Updates existing contacts when needed

### ðŸ“Š Zoho CRM Contact Data Structure
```json
{
  "Email": "user@thegunfirm.com",
  "First_Name": "User",
  "Last_Name": "Name", 
  "Phone": "555-0123",
  "Lead_Source": "Website Registration",
  "Account_Name": "TheGunFirm Customer",
  "Tier": "Bronze",
  "Email_Verified": true
}
```
