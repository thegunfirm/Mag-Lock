# Enhanced Log System - FIXED AND VERIFIED âœ…

## Issue Resolution: SUCCESS STATUS FIXED

The enhanced order activity log system has been successfully fixed to correctly display success statuses for all activity log events.

## ðŸ”§ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### Problem
- Activity logs were showing "success": false even when operations completed successfully
- Database was correctly storing "success" status, but API was not properly accessing the enhanced logger

### Root Cause
- Activity logs API endpoints were using legacy `OrderActivityLogger` instead of new `EnhancedOrderActivityLogger`
- This caused incorrect success status parsing in API responses

### Fix Applied
Updated both activity log API endpoints to use the enhanced logger:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const { OrderActivityLogger } = await import('./services/order-activity-logger');
const rawLogs = await OrderActivityLogger.getOrderLogs(orderId);

// After (fixed)
const { EnhancedOrderActivityLogger } = await import('./services/enhanced-order-activity-logger');
const rawLogs = await EnhancedOrderActivityLogger.getOrderLogs(orderId);
```
