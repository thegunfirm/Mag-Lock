# Firearms Compliance System Implementation

## Status: âœ… CORE SYSTEM COMPLETED

### Architecture Overview

The comprehensive firearms compliance system has been implemented with full Authorize.Net authorization/capture flow, multi-firearm limits with rolling windows, FFL holds, and complete Zoho CRM synchronization.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Services
- âœ… `firearms-compliance-service.ts` - Core compliance logic with rolling window calculations
- âœ… `firearms-checkout-service.ts` - Full checkout flow with compliance-aware processing  
- âœ… `compliance-config-init.ts` - Configuration initialization from environment variables

### 2. Database Schema (All Fields Added)
- âœ… `products.is_firearm` - Firearm identification flag
- âœ… `orders.hold_reason` - Hold type ('FFL', 'Multi-Firearm', NULL)
- âœ… `orders.auth_transaction_id` - Authorize.Net auth transaction for holds
- âœ… `orders.auth_expires_at` - Authorization expiration timestamp
- âœ… `orders.captured_at` - Payment capture timestamp  
- âœ… `orders.ffl_required` - FFL requirement flag
- âœ… `orders.ffl_status` - FFL verification status ('Missing', 'Pending Verification', 'Verified')
- âœ… `orders.ffl_dealer_id` - Reference to FFL dealer
- âœ… `orders.ffl_verified_at` - FFL verification timestamp
- âœ… `orders.firearms_window_count` - Count in rolling window
- âœ… `orders.window_days` - Policy window days (30)
- âœ… `orders.limit_qty` - Policy limit quantity (5)
- âœ… `order_lines.is_firearm` - Denormalized firearm flag per line item
- âœ… `firearms_compliance_settings` - Admin-configurable compliance policies

### 3. API Endpoints (Comprehensive)
- âœ… `GET /api/firearms-compliance/config` - Get compliance configuration
- âœ… `PUT /api/firearms-compliance/config` - Update compliance settings (admin only)
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/check` - Pre-checkout compliance validation
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/checkout` - Full compliance-aware checkout
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/orders/:id/ffl/attach` - Attach FFL to order
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/orders/:id/ffl/verify` - Verify FFL and capture payment  
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/orders/:id/override` - Admin hold override
- âœ… `GET /api/firearms-compliance/orders` - Get orders with compliance info
- âœ… `POST /api/firearms-compliance/orders/:id/void` - Void authorization (admin)

### 4. Configuration (Environment-Driven)
```ini
POLICY_FIREARM_WINDOW_DAYS=30
POLICY_FIREARM_LIMIT=5
FEATURE_MULTI_FIREARM_HOLD=1
FEATURE_FFL_HOLD=1
```

### 5. Compliance Logic Implemented

#### FFL Hold Process
1. âœ… Cart contains firearm â†’ Check for verified FFL on customer account
2. âœ… No FFL found â†’ Create order with `auth-only` transaction
3. âœ… Status: 'Pending FFL', Hold: 'FFL', Payment authorized but not captured
4. âœ… Staff attaches FFL â†’ Status: 'Pending Verification'  
5. âœ… Staff verifies FFL â†’ Capture authorized payment â†’ Status: 'Ready to Fulfill'

#### Multi-Firearm Hold Process  
1. âœ… Calculate past firearms purchased in rolling 30-day window
2. âœ… If past + current â‰¥ 5 firearms â†’ Create hold order
3. âœ… Status: 'Hold â€“ Multi-Firearm', Hold: 'Multi-Firearm'
4. âœ… Admin review required â†’ Manual override â†’ Capture payment

#### Rolling Window SQL (PostgreSQL)
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(l.quantity),0) AS past_qty
FROM orders o
JOIN order_lines l ON l.order_id = o.id  
WHERE o.user_id = $1
  AND l.is_firearm = true
  AND o.status IN ('Paid','Pending FFL','Ready to Fulfill','Shipped')  
  AND o.created_at >= NOW() - (make_interval(days => $2))
```

### 6. Authorize.Net Integration
- âœ… `authOnlyTransaction` - Authorization without capture for holds
- âœ… `capturePriorAuthTransaction` - Capture previously authorized payment
- âœ… `voidTransaction` - Cancel/void authorization before capture  
- âœ… `authCaptureTransaction` - Standard immediate capture for non-hold orders

### 7. Zoho CRM Synchronization  
- âœ… Deal stages mapped: 'Pending FFL', 'Compliance Hold', 'Ready to Fulfill', 'Paid', 'Closed Won', 'Closed Lost'
- âœ… Custom fields: FFL_Required, FFL_Status, FFL_Dealer, Compliance_Hold, Hold_Reason
- âœ… Compliance tracking: Firearms_Window_Count, Window_Days, Limit_Qty, Auth_Transaction_ID  
- âœ… Automated task creation for FFL and multi-firearm holds
- âœ… Real-time status updates throughout compliance workflow

## Order Status Flow

### Normal Flow (No Holds)
Cart â†’ Compliance Check â†’ **Paid** (immediate capture) â†’ Ready to Fulfill â†’ Shipped â†’ Closed Won

### FFL Hold Flow  
Cart â†’ Compliance Check â†’ **Pending FFL** (auth only) â†’ FFL Attached â†’ FFL Verified â†’ **Ready to Fulfill** (capture) â†’ Shipped â†’ Closed Won

### Multi-Firearm Hold Flow
Cart â†’ Compliance Check â†’ **Hold â€“ Multi-Firearm** (auth only) â†’ Admin Review â†’ Override â†’ **Ready to Fulfill** (capture) â†’ Shipped â†’ Closed Won

## Staff Workflow

### FFL Workbench Actions
1. **Attach FFL**: `POST /orders/{id}/ffl/attach` - Link FFL dealer to order
2. **Verify FFL**: `POST /orders/{id}/ffl/verify` - Verify FFL documentation + capture payment  
3. **Override Hold**: `POST /orders/{id}/override` - Admin override with audit logging

### Admin Policy Management
- Adjustable window days (default: 30)
- Adjustable firearm limits (default: 5)  
- Feature toggles for FFL holds and multi-firearm holds
- Real-time policy application to new orders

## Integration Status

### âœ… COMPLETED
- Core compliance service with all business logic
- Database schema with all required fields
- Complete API endpoint coverage  
- Authorize.Net auth/capture/void integration
- Zoho CRM synchronization with custom fields
- Configuration management with environment variables
- Rolling window calculations with PostgreSQL
- Staff action endpoints for FFL workflow
- Admin override capabilities with audit logging

### ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS (Future Enhancements)
- Frontend UI for staff FFL workbench
- Frontend compliance status displays in checkout
- Email notifications for compliance holds  
- Automated FFL verification integration
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Compliance audit trail dashboard

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: FFL Hold
- Cart: 1 firearm product  
- Customer: No verified FFL on file
- Expected: Order created with 'Pending FFL' status, payment authorized but not captured

### Test Case 2: Multi-Firearm Hold  
- Customer: 4 firearms purchased in last 30 days
- Cart: 2 firearm products (total would be 6)
- Expected: Order created with 'Hold â€“ Multi-Firearm' status  

### Test Case 3: Normal Checkout
- Cart: Non-firearm products or under limits with verified FFL
- Expected: Immediate payment capture, 'Paid' status

### Test Case 4: Policy Updates
- Admin changes limit from 5 to 3 firearms  
- Expected: Next checkout honors new 3-firearm limit
