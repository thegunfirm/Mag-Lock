## Critical Architecture Fix Implemented ✅

- ✅ Deal subform contains all dynamic, order-specific, distributor data

## Expected Production Outcomes

1. **Single Products Module Entry**: One SP00735 entry shared across all tiers
2. **Multiple Deal Records**: Separate deals with tier-specific pricing
3. **Proper Field Population**: Correct data flow to appropriate modules
4. **Pricing Differentiation**: Clear validation of 49% Platinum discount vs retail
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Full order lifecycle management in Zoho CRM

## Ready for Production ✅

- ✅ Tier-based pricing differentiation
- ✅ Product/Deal module field separation  
- ✅ Dynamic product lookup by Manufacturer Part Number

## Next Steps for Live Testing
